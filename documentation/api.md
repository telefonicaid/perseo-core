## API

### Rules
Resource | HTTP | Description
--- | --- | ---
/perseo-core/rules | GET | Retrieves all the rules
/perseo-core/rules/{name} | GET | Retrieves the rule with name {name}
/perseo-core/rules | POST | Inserts a new rule (or updates it if it exists)
/perseo-core/rules | PUT | Updates the whole set of rules
/perseo-core/rules/{name} | DELETE | Deletes the rule with name {name}

Each rule is represented as an plain object in JSON with a field `name` with the identifier of the rule inside the engine and a field `text` with the text of the EPL statement of the rule. The field `timeLastStateChange` has a timestamp with the last time when the state of rule changed. In this implementation, that value is the time when the rule was created. The field `state` will be `STARTED` usually, meaning the rule is working. Less frequently it could be `DESTROYED` if the rule has been removed recently and not "garbage-colleted" by the engine *yet*. Since perseo-core 1.8 (and aligned with esper8 upgrade) the meaning of state changed to a boolean which indicates if the statement was destroyed or not.

#### GET (all)

##### DESCRIPTION
Allows to retrieve all the rules

##### URL STRUCTURE
```
http://[HOST]/perseo-core/rules/
```

##### RETURNS
It returns a 200 response including a body with a JSON representation of the array containing all the rules stored in the engine (in memory). If there are not any rules, it will be an empty array. Each item in the array is the representation of the rule as described at the beginning of this section.

Example:  Two rules in the engine
```JSON
[
   {
      "text":"@Audit select \"blood_3_action\" as iotcepaction,* from ev=iotEvent.win:length(3).stat:uni(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,string),float)) output last every 3 events",
      "timeLastStateChange":1407225969166,
      "name":"blood_3",
      "state":"STARTED"
   },
   {
      "text":"@Audit select *,\"blood_4_action\" as iotcepaction,ev.BloodPressure? as Pression, ev.id? as Meter from pattern [every ev=iotEvent(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,String),float)>1.5 and type=\"BloodMeter\")]",
      "timeLastStateChange":1407225930866,
      "name":"blood_4",
      "state":"STARTED"
   }
]
```
Example: There are not any rules
```JSON
[]
```

##### ERRORS
No errors are returned under normal operation. An empty array is returned if there is no data

#### GET

##### DESCRIPTION
Allows to retrieve a rule by name

##### URL STRUCTURE
```
http://[HOST]/perseo-core/rules/{name}
```
* **{name}:** Value identifying the rule

##### RETURNS
It returns a 200 response including a body with a JSON representation of the rule as described in the beginning of the section about rules. If there is not any rule with that `{name}`, a 404 is returned.

Example:  Rule exists
```JSON
{
   "text":"@Audit select \"blood_3_action\" as iotcepaction,* from ev=iotEvent.win:length(3).stat:uni(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,string),float)) output last every 3 events",
   "timeLastStateChange":1407225969166,
   "name":"blood_3",
   "state":"STARTED"
}
```

##### ERRORS

```


#### POST

##### DESCRIPTION
Allows to add a  new rule to the engine

The rule must be provided as a JSON with a field `name` for the name of the rule and an field `text` containing the text of EPL statement of the rule. If a rule with the same name exists, it will be replaced if the text is different.

   "timeLastStateChange":1407225969166,
   "name":"blood_3",
   "state":"STARTED"
}
```

##### ERRORS
If there is a problem processing the rule, a 400 (Bad Request) error is returned with a description of the error in a `error` field inside a JSON. Possible errors are

* missing name
* missing text for EPL statement
* incorrect JSON format, non parseable
* incorrect syntax or semantic of the EPL statement

Example: Incorrect EPL statement
```JSON
{
   "error":"Failed to resolve event type: Event type or class named 'iotEvent2' was not found [@Audit select *,\"blood_4_action\" as iotcepaction,ev.BloodPressure? as Pression, ev.id? as Meter from pattern [every ev=iotEvent2(cast(cast(BloodPressure?,String),float)>1.5 and type=\"BloodMeter\")]]"
